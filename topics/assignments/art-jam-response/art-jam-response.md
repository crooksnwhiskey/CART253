### Art Jam Response

The first project that I had the pleasure of viewing was from [Benjamin Merhi](https://g3thsemane.github.io/CART253/topics/Self-Portrait/). I was very impressed by the creativity in his code, specifically how he was able to keep his head together with constant offsets. Using offsets is something that I briefly thought about using in my own project, but I thought it might be too daunting; however, seeing it in Benjamin's code makes it seem less scary, as he did a good job of making it clear and made good use of comments. I also was impressed by how smooth the interactivity in his project was. Adding the collision barrier to the head was smart, and makes the program feel more advanced, and the mouseReleased function ties everything together, making it so you don't have to restart the program everytime you move the head. As for the visual aspect of the project, I like the overall Minecraft-esque look of it and I really like the subtle change of colours used for shading. I also didn't think to add a title directly on my page, which I think was a nice addition. Overall, a very good and fun project.

The second project I saw was from [Dyna Benaziza](https://dynabenaziza-beep.github.io/cart-253-/art-jam/). I was immediately in awe at the visual aspect of the program, and the code behind it was just as impressive. The spiral in particular was my favourite part. The way it was made was super cool and would take me forever to figure out on my own. I see the use of beziers throughout the code, which impresses me because in my own program, I spent hours trying to configure a singular bezier curve, so I can only applaud the effort that was shown here.
