### Mod Jam Response

The first project that I played is [Benjamin Merhi's](https://g3thsemane.github.io/CART253/topics/Mod-Jam). I liked his approach of making the tongue always active by simply always checking the tongues state while the game is running. This is such a simple way to make the game feel so much more tense and panicked! something else that I appreaciated in his code was the fade screen effect. I was looking for a way to do this in my art jam project so its cool to see a version of it that is more advanced and more up to date with our programming skills. as for the experience itself, I like how the game has a clear theme, it adds to the playability.

The second project I saw was from [Dyna Benaziza](https://dynabenaziza-beep.github.io/cart-253-/mod-jam%20/ ). I didnt put together that you could just do something like "flies.push" to add new flies. This is also something that I wanted to do in my project but I thought it would be too tedious to accomplish so I gave up on the idea. I might take inspiration from this in future projects. It's funny to see how my brain can sometimes overcomplicate things because the way they did the heart system is also much simpler than I would've thought. By doing some if statements and having a "lives" function, the proccess is much clearer to me now. I like the fact that eating a fly in this game feels so important because it changes the whole map and gives you a visual cue that you are one step closer to victory!

The last game I played belonged to [Daniel Michurov](https://cakeallen.github.io/cart253/mod-jam/index.html). This game felt very advanced and I feel like a lot of little things helped build up the polished feel of this game. I really like the thinking process behind the probability of each letter, letting the program generate a random number between 0 and 1 and then using its answer as which letter pops up is genius. something that I wouldve never thought of is how they did the heath and stamina bars. I could never have thought to get a percentage based on a value and then multiply it with the width of the bar!!! I'm glad I got to see it here! Although they call it useless in their code, I think adding a little cursor delay does do alot in making the game just slightly more annoying. I was staring at the code about how he got the frog to stay still while the tongue is out and I couldnt understand it at first. I quickly realized that it's so simple and efficient and im mad I didnt think of it. only making the moveFrog function work while the tongue is idle is so smart and not at all how I thought of it. I also really liked the theme of this game, and I think the dark souls vibe really came through, although a souls like soundtrack would've been awesome. overall an awesome project that I learned a lot from.
