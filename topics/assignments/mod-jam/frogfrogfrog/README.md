how to play: The goal of Phraug is to stay alive as long as possible while getting the highest score possible. Click your mouse button to extend tongue and try to catch flies.

There are 3 ways to die in this game:

First, if you let your eyes (controlled with a & d) touch the ground, you die. 

Second, if the frog touches the edges of the screen, you die. 
To move the frog, place your cursor on either the left of the screen to go right, or place your cursor on the right side of the screen to go left

Third, if your score reaches 0, you die.
Your score is always going down, BUT: if you catch a fly, your score goes up, if you let a fly reach the end, your score goes down.
