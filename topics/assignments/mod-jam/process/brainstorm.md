# Mod Jam brainstorm

1. make the flies move at random (this can be done with random, how to I make it not too crazy? is it random on both axis or just one? )

2. some flies can hurt you(they can be poisonous, you would have to have some sort of health system. other flying objects?)

3. wwhat if you are the fly(many frogs try to get you, or maybe you are a giant fly fighting back against the frogs)

4. point system(something to tell you how you are doing, score system for time? how many you have? would missing affect score? what else could affect score?)

5. start screen and end screen(this could be fun. add intor and outro music? would need a way to win or lose)

6. add obstacles( could be dodging with frog or just the tongue, what would the obstacles be. where are they coming from)

7. frogs tongue is floppy(you could swing it around like a limp noodle. the tongue could always be out. the whole tongue could be sticky.)

8. frog is hard to control(maybe hes fighting your mouse input? he could be on a delay. )

9. a way to win(could be you need to get a certain amount in a timeframe, could be survive for some time, could be beat boss, could be clear rooms? then id have to add rooms)

10. a way to lose( could be a health system. could be losing to time. could be no way to win, only lose, but highscore)

11. ramp up difficulty(game gets harder how? flies get more unpredictable? frog gets slower? obstacles get more frequent?)

12. make the flies fight back(do they shoot lasers? what do flies even do? they give you diseases???)

13. punish for missing flies(this ties into lose system? healthbar? score affected? something arbitrary?)

14. boss flyght?(how does the boss summon? what does it look like? what can you do to beat him? does he fight back? do you win after?)

15. frog isnt stuck to bottom(he could move with cursor. maybe move around the perimeter? move with cursor on delay?)

16. cooler graphics(idk how to do this. could somehow overlay a screen effect? how do I get different textures?)

17. control multiple aspects of frog(like a foddian game? what else can you control other than tongue and frog. maybe legs? make it like qwop?)

18. remake frog look(make a better normal frog? make it themed? not a frog at all?)

19. frog has physics( maybe make it freely move around the cursor so youd have to spin it to allign the tongue? make him bouncy?make him tipsy)

20. different environments (envronments change? what will they do to affect player? maybe they affect the flies? what kind of biomes?)
