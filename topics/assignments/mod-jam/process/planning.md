 make the frog have rotation controlled by keys.
 idk how to make the tongue sync.
i give up on the tongue, new mechanic instead


make the title page nicer

Add end screen to show score and show time 

add scoring system to reward good flies eaten and take away score for bad flies
maybe a time limit that goes up/down depending on the fly

add fly movement to make the flies harder and add bad flies

add audio/visual effects
